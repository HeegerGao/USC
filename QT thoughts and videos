some great demo of qtrobot:

thoughts:

1. we can use face detecion to let the robot track the children's faces, so it can look more interactive. 
2. we should not repete any same sentence(maybe even gesture) in one experiment to let it be more real.
3. combine the gesture with the emotion and word to set some series of interface

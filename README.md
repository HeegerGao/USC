# Orthoses And QTrobot:<br>Helping Children Express Nonverbal Intensions
## 0 Background Information
Dystonia is a movement disorder in which a person's muscles contract uncontrollably. The contraction causes the affected body part to twist involuntarily, resulting in repetitive movements or abnormal postures.<br>Physical therapy is a common method of treating dystonia, but it requires a small number of specialists and is expensive. At the same time, these patients are often unable to communicate verbally, so understanding their nonverbal intentions and helping them express nonverbal intentions are essential.<br><br>

In this project, we conducted two experiments on children (around 11 years old) with dystonia: 
* Orthoses Experiment: if children with orthoses can express their nonverbal intentions better.
* QTrobot Experiment:  if children are more willing to interact with a humanoid robot than normal electronic equipment, for example, a screen.<br>

Draco Malfoy | Slytherin | 90


We designed a set of “number games” for children to play with a robot called QTrobot to test the two metrics during the game and collect all kinds of data (raw video, audio etc.) for later analysis.<br> During the game, QTrobot will do different speaking, listening, guessing and other kinds of gestures and a lot of emotions to interact with children, and we designed encouraging and rewarding feedback for QTrobot during the game to make children more comfortable. In addition, we also did the work of using the camera to identify the thumb orientation, which is used in the game.

Children would thinke a number between 1~100 and QTrobot would guess randomly, and children would ues "thumb up" or "thumb down" to interact with QTrobot to say "yes" or "no".
